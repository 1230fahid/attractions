    1) What did I do so far?
        a. Created CRUD for attractions
        b. Making parameters required
    2) What to work on now?
        a. Create index for separate continent? Maybe get rid of continents overall and do countries and regions?
        b. Create index for separate countries and list all regions?
        c. Handle errors from server-side and client-side
        d. Create world map, that when you pick on a country, reveals the tourist attractions in the country?
            a) Should it reveal where exactly in the country?
            b) When you pick a country, list out the link to the show page for each attraction?
        e. Leave a review for each country?
        f. Search bar at top of page acts like control + f and looks for what text matches?
